# MyLittleArray.jl

Very small and fast immutable arrays with very little features.

You probably want [ImmutableArrays.jl](https://github.com/twadleigh/ImmutableArrays.jl/),
but this will do in a hurry.

The main reason I wrote this was to make an immutable arrays 
package with everything written out explicitly, to compare 
against the code generated through metaprogramming in 
ImmutableArrays.jl.
